**MadLib Game**

*I made a separate file for the frequently used functions*

This program uses Tkinter as a Game in which players input random words, and the computer creates a story from the inputed words. There are three story options, and each has a varying amount of input. Once input is entered and Create Story button is clicked, the story is generated, along with a randomized grade of the story, and a button to play again. This button closes all windows and starts it all over.
